Machine learning deployment workflow

## 1. Data management

* Data collection
* Data preprocessing
* Data augmentation
* Data analysis

## 2. Model learning

* Model selection
* Training
* Hyper-parameter selection

## 3. Model verification

* Requirement encoding
    - Performance metrics, business driven metrics
* Formal verification
    - Regulatory frameworks
* Test-based verification, checking that the model generalizes well to the previously unseen data.
    - Simulation-based testing

## 4. Model deployment

* Integration
    - Operational support
    - Reuse of code and models
    - Software engineering anti-patterns
    - Mixed team dynamics
* Monitoring
    - Feedback loops
    - Outlier detection
    - Custom design tooling
* Updating
    - Concept drift
    - Continuous delivery

## 5. Cross-cutting aspects

* Ethics
    - Country-level regulations
    - Focus on technical solution only
    - Aggravation of biases
    - Authorship
    - Decision making
* End user's trust
    - Involvement of end users
    - User experience
    - Explainability score
* Security
    - Data poisoning
    - Model stealing
    - Model inversion
